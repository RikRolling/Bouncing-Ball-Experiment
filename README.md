Bouncing Ball Experiment

Calculates number of bounces (n) over minimum height (h_min),
using the principle of conservation of energy.
Also, calculates time (total_t) to complete this number of bounces.
Using user inputs h,h_min and eta (where eta represents the efficiency).

User inputs:

- starting height of ball (in meters)
- minimum height of ball (i.e. the lowest height the ball achieves)
- efficiency (a value between 0 and 1, which accounts for energy loss between bounces)
